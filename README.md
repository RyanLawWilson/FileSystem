# <p align="center">Custom File System</p>
This project is a C# Console Application that simulates a File System.  Users can add, remove, and rename files and folders.  C# classes represent the files and folders that the user changes.  If a user wants to know what commands they can use, they can type in `help` to see a list of all commands.  You can even type in `help add` to see how to use the `add` command, for example.
